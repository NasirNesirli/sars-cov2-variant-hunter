# Results Directory

This directory contains the output files from the variant calling pipeline.

## Subdirectories

### `aligned/`
Contains BAM files from read alignment:
- `aligned_reads.bam` - Raw aligned reads
- `sorted_reads.bam` - Coordinate-sorted reads
- `sorted_reads.bam.bai` - BAM index file

### `vcf/`
Contains variant call files:
- `raw_variants.vcf` - All called variants (unfiltered)
- `final_variants.vcf` - High-quality filtered variants (QUAL>20, DP>20)

## Notes

These files are regenerated each time the pipeline runs.
Large BAM files are excluded from git tracking (see `.gitignore`).
